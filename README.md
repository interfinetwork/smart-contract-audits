# Smart Contract Audits By InterFi Network
InterFi provides blockchain security and assessment services. In this repository, we'll upload audited smart contracts, and projects. To request a smart contract audit, contact https://t.me/interfiaudits or hello@interfi.network


# InterFi's Echelon Auditing Methodology

The aim of InterFi’s “Echelon” standard is to analyze the smart contract and identify the vulnerabilities and the hacks in the smart contract. Mentioned are the steps used by ECHELON-1 to assess the smart contract:

1.	Solidity smart contract source code reviewal:

Review of the specifications, sources, and instructions provided to InterFi to make sure we understand the size, scope, and functionality of the smart contract. 

Manual review of code, which is the process of reading source code line-byline to identify potential vulnerabilities.

2.	Static, Manual, and Automated AI analysis:

Test coverage analysis, which is the process of determining whether the test cases are covering the code and how much code is exercised when we run those test cases.

Symbolic execution, which is analysing a program to determine what inputs causes each part of a program to execute. 

3.	Best practices review, which is a review of the smart contracts to improve efficiency, effectiveness, clarify, maintainability, security, and control based on the established industry and academic practices, recommendations, and research. 

4.	Specific, itemized, actionable recommendations to help you take steps to secure your smart contracts.


# Important Disclaimer

InterFi Network provides contract auditing and project verification services for blockchain projects. The purpose of the audit is to analyse the on-chain smart contract source code, and to provide basic overview of the project. This report should not be transmitted, disclosed, referred to, or relied upon by any person for any purposes without InterFi’s prior written consent.

InterFi provides the easy-to-understand assessment of the project, and the smart contract (otherwise known as the source code). The audit makes no statements or warranties on the security of the code. It also cannot be considered as an enough assessment regarding the utility and safety of the code, bug-free status, or any other statements of the contract. While we have used all the data at our disposal to provide the transparent analysis, it is important to note that you should not rely on this report only — we recommend proceeding with several independent audits and a public bug bounty program to ensure the security of smart contracts. Be aware that smart contracts deployed on a blockchain aren’t resistant from external vulnerability, or a hack. Be aware that active smart contract owner privileges constitute an elevated impact to smart contract’s safety and security. Therefore, InterFi does not guarantee the explicit security of the audited smart contract.

The analysis of the security is purely based on the smart contracts alone. No applications or operations were reviewed for security. No product code has been reviewed.

This report should not be considered as an endorsement or disapproval of any project or team. The information provided on this report does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice and you should not treat any of the report’s content as such. Do conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
